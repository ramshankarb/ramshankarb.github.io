					<H3>QuadCopter</H3>
					</header>
					<p>Providing vision to the quadcopter<br>
					Using sensors to guide the quadcopter from point A to point B without obstructing any obstacles placed inbetween the point. We made quadcopter right from the scratch. But as the sensors we used were not efficient enough it did get struck by some obstacles. To overcome we used fuzzy logics which was able to do to an extent. We got huge appreciations from our college and our juniors took it from us to improvise more on it as our tenure came to an end.

					<p>Migration of applications from IBM server to JBOSS<br>
					As JBOSS is open source and free we migrated applications running in IBM to JBOSS. As part of it we changed the framework from Struts to the latest Spring. Project tenure was 4 months. My first project in TCS. It was a great learning curve. Working with architects and leads gave me an insight on how project is moved from development to production.
